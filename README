Description
-----------

MediapProxy is a media relay for RTP and RTCP streams that works in
tandem with OpenSER to provide NAT traversal capability for media streams
from user agents located behind NAT. 

When using MediaProxy, NAT traversal for RTP media will work without any
settings in the SIP User Agents or the NAT router.

Background
-----------

MediaProxy is the successor of MediaProxy. It is based on a complete new
design that allowed for major improvements in areas like scalability (an
order of magnitude more scalable than previous version) and security
(communication between relay and dispatcher is encrypted). 

New features have been added to support call flows related to user mobility
and fax transmission.


Features
--------

 - Scalability of thousands of calls per server limited only by the Linux
   kernel networking layer
 - TLS encryption between the relays and dispatcher
 - T.38 fax support
 - Lawful intercept for RTP media
 - Graceful shutdown capability
 - Modular design for custom selection algorithms of the relay location
 - Automatic load balancing and redundancy among all servers
 - Real-time sessions statistics
 - Configurable IP and UDP port range
 - Support for any combination of audio and video streams
 - Accounting of IP network traffic
 - Logging in Radius of all media information history (like
   addition/subtraction of streams, their type and duration).


Compatibility and pre-requisites
--------------------------------

To run the software, you need a computer running Linux Operating System that
has been compiled with connection tracking support (conntrack). Because of
this dependency to the Linux kernel, other operating systems are not
supported.

MediaProxy components are not compatible with any previous versions of
MediaProxy.

MediaProxy is meant to be used together with OpenSER's mediaproxy-ng
module. 

OpenSER 1.4 or higher is required.

MediaProxy does not affect the use of ICE between clients.

No STUN or TURN support are required in the clients.

The SIP User Agents must work symmetric (that is to send and receive data on
the same port for each stream), which is documented in RFC 4961.

To display the history of the media streams from the Radius accounting
CDRTool 6.5 or higher is required.

Some features have been removed in comparison to the previous version:

- Support for multiple domains have been discontinued
- Support for DNS records have been removed
- Support for asymmetric clients have been discontinued
- Support for other operating systems than Linux have been discontinued
