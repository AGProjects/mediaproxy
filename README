Description
-----------

MediaProxy is a media relay for RTP/RTCP and UDP streams that works in
tandem with OpenSER to provide NAT traversal capability for media streams
from SIP user agents located behind NAT.

When using MediaProxy, NAT traversal for RTP media will work without any
settings in the SIP User Agents or the NAT router.

Background
-----------

MediaProxy 2.0 is the second generation media relay application which is
based on a completely new design that allows for major improvements in areas
such as scalability (an order of magnitude more scalable than previous
version) and security (communication between relay and dispatcher is
encrypted).

New features have been added to support call flows related to user mobility
and fax transmission.


Features
--------

 - Scalability of thousands of calls per server limited only by the Linux
   kernel networking layer and network interface bandwidth
 - TLS encryption between the relays and dispatcher
 - T.38 fax support
 - Graceful shutdown capability
 - Modular design for custom selection algorithms for the relay location
 - Automatic load balancing and redundancy among all media relays
 - Real-time sessions statistics
 - Configurable IP and UDP port range
 - Support for any combination of audio and video streams
 - Radius accounting of IP network traffic
 - Logging of complete media information including all streams, their type,
   their codec and duration.


Compatibility and pre-requisites
--------------------------------

To run the software, you will need a server running the Linux Operating
System using a kernel version 2.6.18 or higher that has been compiled with
connection tracking support (conntrack). Because of this dependency on
Linux, other operating systems are not supported. This dependency only
applies to the media relay component. The dispatcher component which runs on
the same host as OpenSER, can run on any platform that has a python
interpreter and supports the twisted framework.

Communication between the dispatcher and the relays uses TLS encryption and
requires a set of X509 certificates to work. For more information about this
please read tls/README which contains information about the sample certificates
that are included as well as information about how to generate your own.

MediaProxy is meant to be used together with OpenSER's mediaproxy module.

This version of MediaProxy (2.0 or higher) cannot be used in combination
with any version of OpenSER older than 1.4 or any components of MediaProxy
older than 2.0. You must completely upgrade any previous installation of
OpenSER and MediaProxy to these new versions.

No STUN or TURN support are required in the clients.

The SIP User Agents must work symmetrically (that is to send and receive
data on the same port for each stream), which is documented in RFC 4961.

To display the history of the media streams CDRTool 6.5 or higher is
required.

Some features that were present in the previous version have been removed:

- Support for specifying media relays per domain has been discontinued
- Support for DNS records has been discontinued
- Support for asymmetric clients has been discontinued
- Support for other operating systems than Linux has been discontinued
  (only for the media relay, as the dispatcher has no such limitation)
