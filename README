Description
-----------

MediapProxy is a media relay for RTP and RTCP streams that works in
tandem with OpenSER to provide NAT traversal capability for media streams
from SIP user agents located behind NAT. 

When using MediaProxy, NAT traversal for RTP media will work without any
settings in the SIP User Agents or the NAT router.

Background
-----------

This version of MediaProxy is the successor of MediaProxy originally written
by Dan Pascu in 2004. It is based on a complete new design that allowed for
major improvements in areas like scalability (an order of magnitude more
scalable than previous version) and security (communication between relay
and dispatcher is encrypted).

New features have been added to support call flows related to user mobility
and fax transmission.


Features
--------

 - Scalability of thousands of calls per server limited only by the Linux
   kernel networking layer
 - TLS encryption between the relays and dispatcher
 - T.38 fax support
 - Graceful shutdown capability
 - Modular design for custom selection algorithms of the relay location
 - Automatic load balancing and redundancy among all servers
 - Real-time sessions statistics
 - Configurable IP and UDP port range
 - Support for any combination of audio and video streams
 - Radius accounting of IP network traffic
 - Logging of complete media information including all streams, their type,
   their codec and duration.


Compatibility and pre-requisites
--------------------------------

To run the software, you need a computer running Linux Operating System
using kernel family 2.6 or higher that has been compiled with connection
tracking support (conntrack). Because of this dependency to the Linux
kernel, other operating systems are not supported.

MediaProxy is meant to be used together with OpenSER's mediaproxy module.

This version of MediaProxy (2.0 or higher) cannot be used in combination
with any version of OpenSER older than 1.4 or any components of MediaProxy
older than 2.0. You must completely upgrade any previous installation of
OpenSER and MediaProxy to these new versions.

No STUN or TURN support are required in the clients.

The SIP User Agents must work symmetric (that is to send and receive data on
the same port for each stream), which is documented in RFC 4961.

To display the history of the media streams CDRTool 6.5 or higher is
required.

Some features have been removed in comparison to the previous version:

- Support for multiple domains have been discontinued
- Support for DNS records have been removed
- Support for asymmetric clients have been discontinued
- Support for other operating systems than Linux have been discontinued
