.SH NAME
media\-relay \- the MediaProxy relay
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B media\-relay
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
MediaProxy is a distributed far end NAT traversal solution for media streams
of SIP calls. MediaProxy has a dispatcher running on the same host with the
OpenSIPS proxy and multiple media relays distributed over the network.
.PP
\fBmedia\-relay\fP is to be run on a system that wishes to participate in media
relaying. It can be run on the same host as the dispatcher, or on multiple
remote hosts. The relay takes care of establishing a path between devices
behind NAT and forwards the media streams between them. To do so, the relay
requires a Linux kernel, version 2.6.18 or newer compiled with support for
connection tracking, the connection tracking event notification API and the
netfilter "NOTRACK" target.
.PP
The MediaProxy relay features secure encrypted communication with the
dispatcher and has gracefull shutdown capabilities, where it refuses to
accept new sessions and shuts down after all the existing sessions are done.
