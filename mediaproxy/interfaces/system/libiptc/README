The files under this directory and its subdirectories were copied verbatim
from the iptables source. The main reason for this is to allow _conntrack.c
to compile even if libiptc is not present on the system. This was mainly
motivated by the decision of the debian iptables package maintainer to stop
including libiptc in the iptables-dev package, but in the end it can help
with other linux distributions as well, as it simplifies the build procedure.

All the files in this directory and its subdirectories are copyright by their
