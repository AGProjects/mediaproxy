Description: MediaProxy common files
 MediaProxy is a distributed far end NAT traversal solution for media streams
 of SIP calls. MediaProxy has a dispatcher running on the same host with the
 OpenSIPS proxy and multiple media relays distributed over the network.
 The media relays work by manipulating conntrack rules in the Linux kernel to
 create paths that forward the media streams between the 2 SIP user agents
 participating in the call. Because it avoids to copy stream data from kernel
 space to user space and back to kernel space like other implementations,
 MediaProxy can handle much more media streams at a time, limited only to the
 network interface bandwidth and the Linux kernel network layer processing
 speed.
 .
 MediaProxy features secure encrypted communication between the dispatcher
 and the relays, advanced accounting capabilities using multiple backends,
 support for any combination of audio and video streams, realtime statistics,
 T.38 fax support as well as automatic load balancing and redundancy among
 the active relays.
 .
 This package includes files common to all MediaProxy packages.
