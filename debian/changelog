mediaproxy (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mention libnetfilter-conntrack in the installation requirements section
  * Added note about using distribution provided kernel images
  * Renamed OpenSER to OpenSIPs
  * Do accounting only after a 200 OK response was received, which is
    indicated by the presence of the to_tag that is not sent by OpenSIPS
    for provisional replies, but only with the 200 OK
  * Have synthetic test scripts look for the mediaproxy module in current and
    parent directories automatically
  * In the synthetic tests have OpenSIPS send the to tag only with 200 OK
  * Added synthetic test script to test provisional responses from two
    different PSTN gateways with varying to tags
  * Enhanced kernel version parsing to support non-standard named kernels
    (i.e. major.minor.revision.extra)
  * Updated debian standards version
  * Rephrased description in manual pages and debian control file
  * Restructured and improved documentation to better describe how to install
  * Improved dictionary parsing in RADIUS accounting module
  * Update support section in readme
  * Added management interface for OpenSIPS
  * Fix for relay cleanup timer when dispatcher is restarted
  * Modified dispatcher to store dialog_id for sessions and use the OpenSIPS
    management interface to send BYEs when a session did timeout
  * Added dialog_id value to test scripts
  * Simplified parsing of headers received from OpenSIPs in dispatcher
  * Fixed ExpireWatcher port comparison to be done as a 16-bit unsigned int
  * Remove all matching iptables entries on Inhibitor dealloc in order to
    remove stray entries that are leftover after crashes
  * Added per-stream post-dial delay to the session statistics
  * Record the post dial delay from the first stream into radius accounting
  * Added note to INSTALL about official Debian repositories from AG Projects
  * Added note to INSTALL about where to find the changelog
  * Updated the feature list in README with the latest additions
  * Fixed regression from 1.x that prevented chaining of mediaproxies
  * Ignore invalid accounting module names in the configuration and log an
    error about them instead of raising an exception
  * Gracefully report the errors that occur while reading the radius
    configuration file and then exit, instead of throwing an exception
  * The radius configuration file may be relative to the config directory
  * Do not cache database inserted rows to avoid the need to clean the cache
    or otherwise have an ever increasing application memory footprint
  * Capture and report database errors when inserting statistics records
  * Use MyISAM for the media_sessions table
  * Improved the database accounting speed about 3 times using raw queries
  * Create the table for database accounting on startup if it doesn't exist
  * Removed pool_size database option and use a single database connection
  * Reworded the tls README a bit for clarity
  * Added OpenSIPS section to the config.ini.sample
  * Added documentation sections for accounting and closing expired calls
  * Added minimum version dependency for libnetfilter-conntrack in INSTALL
  * Encode applications and codecs from all streams, not only the first one,
    in the radius accounting backend
  * Log the post-dial delay in radius accounting as Acct-Delay-Time
  * Capture and log radius exceptions
