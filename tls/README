The certificates in this directory are provided only as samples to make it
easy for someone to try out mediaproxy for testing/evaluation pruposes or to
have an example of what the certificates need to contain.

Do _NOT_ use them in a production environment, as anyone who has downloaded
mediaproxy will be able to connect to your servers using them.
