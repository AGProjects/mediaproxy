Architecture
------------

MediaProxy is made up of (at least) two components: A dispatcher and a relay.

The dispatcher component always runs on the same host as OpenSER and
communicates with its mediaproxy module through a UNIX domain socket. The
relay(s) connect to the dispatcher using TLS. This relay component may be on
the same or on a different host as OpenSER. There may be several relays for
the dispatcher to choose from and a relay may service more than one
dispatcher.

When OpenSER requests that a call be relayed, the dispatcher will forward
this request to one of its connected relays, along with some data from the
SDP. The relay will allocate a set of UDP ports for this session, depending
on the number of proposed streams. It will inform the dispatcher which ports
it has allocated so that it may in turn notify the mediaproxy module of
OpenSER, which will replace the relevant parts of the SDP.

The same is done for any SIP messages from the callee, thus all the media
streams will be sent through the relay. When the session between caller and
callee has finished, either through a SIP BYE or because the media is no
longer flowing and has timed out, the relay will send session information to
the dispatcher, which can store this information using one or more accounting
modules.

The session information may also be queried using a management interface on
the dispatcher.

All of this is illustrated in the following diagram:

Packaging
---------

The MediaProxy source already includes the necessary files to build Debian
packages. They should probably also work without changes for Ubuntu, though
they have not been tested with it.


Operation
---------

Before the relay is run, please make sure that /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
is set to "1".

Both the dispatcher and the relay should be executed with root privileges.
With no arguments, both applications will automatically fork into the
background and log to syslog. They can remain in the foreground and log to
console when given the --no-fork argument.

The relay can be shut down in two ways. When receiving either an INT or TERM
signal, the relay will terminate all of its sessions immediately and inform
the dispatcher that those sessions have expired. When given the HUP signal,
it will not accept any new sessions from the dispatcher and wait for all of
the running sessions to expire, thus terminating gracefully.

Both the dispatcher and the relay read their configuration from
/etc/mediaproxy/config.ini. A sample configuration file is provided which
should be self-explanatory. At the very least a set of TLS credentials is
required. Sample certificates for this are included in the tls/ subdirectory.
DO NOT USE THESE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, but only for testing purposes.
For more information about TLS certificates and how to generate your own,
check the tls/README file.


Management interface
--------------------

The management interface will accept commands terminated by \r\n. It will
return the results of the command, one per line, terminated by an empty
line (also \r\n terminated).

Currently two commands are supported:

sessions : This will have the dispatcher query all of its connected relays
           for active sessions. For every sessions it finds it will return
           one line with a JSON encoded dictionary containing session
           information.

summary : This will have the dispatcher present a summary of each of its
          connected relays. The results are returned as a JSON encoded
          dictionary, one line per relay.
