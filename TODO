- Lawful intercept for RTP media
- Selection of mediaproxy based on proximity
- Add ability to relay to restart on the fly without losing the sessions
- Minimize interruption caused by a dispatcher restart
- Make traffic calculation more efficient
- Only log connection state transitions to avoid too much logging in case
  the dispatcher is down and the relay can't reconnect.
- Allow the NAT address to change during a call to accomodate ISPs that
  dynamically allocate IP addresses and change them at regular intervals.
  This has to work even without any signaling support, based on the SSRC
  field in the RTP media stream. For protection, switching the NAT address
  should only happen if the old NAT address didn't send anything for a while,
  while the new NAT has sent a stream with the same SSRC field.
